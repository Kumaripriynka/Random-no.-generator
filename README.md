# Random-no.-generator
I have created a  simple game using basic concepts of javaScript in which it  takes an input from the user to tell them whether the guess was correct,greater or lesser than the original number.100 - (no. of guesses) is the score of the user the program is expected to terminate once the number is guessed.Number should be between 1-100.
